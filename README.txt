All three programs should be working as expected. Any differences in Program 3 behaviour from test bench are explained in /Program 3/Testbench Modification. Getting the third program working was challenging due to infinite loops making it hard to debug. Since I am using 8 bits for instructions, trying to come up with an instruction set which doesn't over complicate control was slightly challenging, however, I ended up using most of the instructions in my ISA quite evenly (making it challenging to have just 7 bit instructions).
